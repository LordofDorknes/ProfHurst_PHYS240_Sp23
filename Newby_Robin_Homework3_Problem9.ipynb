    "This result is slightly unphysical, as it implies the speed can increase without bound due to the lack of air resistance. The original differential equation also allows that the initial acceleration get arbitrarily large if the biker begins at an arbitrarily slow speed, blowing up if the biker begins stationary. These are simply consequences of the differential equation, rather than errors in analysis however, so they're not anything to worry about given that this is just a simplified model.\n"

    "Supposedly, a cyclist will average between 75 and 400 Watts of power output over a one hour workout depending on fitness level. I'll got with 200W for a moderately fit bicyclist.\n",
    "The avg american weighs roughly 80kg (~180lbs) and the avg bike weighs something like 12kg. This gives a combined mass of 92kg, which I'll round up to 100kg to account for clothes and a backpack plus a bit of extra body weight. While the average professional cyclist likely weighs significantly less, this will do just fine since we're fudging a variety of factors, and not assuming a professional athlete is the one powering the bike."
