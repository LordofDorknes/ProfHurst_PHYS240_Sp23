    "A simple electronic circuit pictured in Fig. 2 contains one resistor and one capacitor.\n",
    "This circuit acts as a low-pass filter: you send a signal in on the left, and it comes out filtered on the right. Using Ohm’s law and the laws governing capacitors, and assuming that the output load has very high impedance (so that a negligible amount of current flows through it), we can write down the equations governing this circuit as follows. Let I be the current that flows through R and into the capacitor, and let Q be the charge on the capacitor. Then\n",

Small values give more accurate results, but the program will take longer to run. Try a variety of different values and choose one for your final calculations that seems sensible to you."
